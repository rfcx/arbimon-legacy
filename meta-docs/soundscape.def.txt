We define a Soundscape as a time/frequency surface plot of a given feature in a set of recordings.
Our soundscapes plot the number of recording of a specific time having a peak in a specific frequency region above a threshold amplitude in their computed mean spectrum.
We express the amplitudes as a real number from 0 to 1, and can be taken as either relative to the maximum amplitude value within all recordings used in the soundscape, or
a an absolute value where 1 is the highest amplitude that can be represented in each recording.

For computing the mean spectrum of a recording and its peaks we use the meanspec and fpeaks functions from the seewave R package. 
To compare with absolute amplitude thresholds we normalize the recording samples so that 1 is the highest represented value in the audio channel.
To compare with relative to maximum amplitude thresholds we compute the maximum amplitude within the set of recordings and scale the threshold so that 1 represents this maximum value.
